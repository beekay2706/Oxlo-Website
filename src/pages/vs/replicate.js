Oxlo.ai provides a fixed, Request-Based API model ($49.90/mo for 2000 requests daily) offering a mix of open-source LLMs (Qwen 3, Llama 3) and Image Generation capabilities without the time-based compute anxiety."

      answer: "Yes, for developers and startups wanting predictability over their inference budgets. While Replicate bills on active GPU time and inference instances, Oxlo.ai relies on simple requests-per-day service levels."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Oxlo.ai support multimodal and diffusion models?",
      answer: "Yes, Oxlo.ai offers models for Text (LLMs like Qwen, Mistral, Llama), Audio (Whisper), Vision, and Image Generation pipelines via an OpenAI SDK compatible structure."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Request-Based pricing?",
      answer: "You purchase a fixed cap - e.g., 2000 API calls daily. As long as you generate under that limit, the cost of generating long paragraphs vs short paragraphs is effectively $0 beyond your base subscription."
