  const tldr = "OpenRouter essentially aggregates APIs from multiple providers, operating as an inference router. They charge per-token, passing along provider costs plus their margin. Oxlo.ai is fundamentally different - we host the inference hardware ourselves (like A100s and L40s) and offer a Request-Based API. This means Oxlo can offer flat-rate pricing ($49.90/mo for 2000 requests per day) that simply does not exist on aggregator platforms."

      question: "Is Oxlo.ai an OpenRouter alternative?",
      answer: "Yes, Oxlo.ai is a drop-in replacement alternative for users looking to switch from token-based aggregators to a fixed-price inference endpoint."
    },
    {
      question: "Why should I switch from OpenRouter?",
      answer: "Aggregators inherently carry variable billing. As your AI product scales, token bills compound dramatically - especially for heavy context (RAG) prompts. By switching to Oxlo's request-based pricing, your costs become completely fixed and predictable."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use OpenAI SDK to migrate?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Oxlo.ai supports 100% standard OpenAI API structures. Update the base API URL and your integration will continue seamlessly."
