  const tldr = "Oxlo.ai is a drop-in replacement for Together AI with a fundamentally different pricing model. While Together AI charges per token - causing costs to scale linearly with prompt length - Oxlo.ai charges a flat request-based rate. For engineering teams running RAG pipelines, agents, or long-context window tasks, Oxlo.ai is significantly cheaper and offers more predictable billing. Both providers are fully OpenAI SDK compatible."

  const cost_table = [
    { workload: "1,000 requests (3,000 tokens/req on Llama 3 70B)", competitor: "$2.70", oxlo: "$0.00 (Flat Daily Rate)", savings: "~$81/mo" },
    { workload: "10,000 requests (8,000 tokens/req on Llama 3 70B)", competitor: "$72.00", oxlo: "$0.00 (Flat Daily Rate)", savings: "~$2,100/mo" },
    { workload: "50,000 requests (15,000 tokens/req on Qwen 72B)", competitor: "$675.00", oxlo: "$0.00 (Flat Daily Rate)", savings: "~$20,000/mo" },

    {
      question: "How is Oxlo.ai different from Together AI?",
      answer: "The primary difference is the business model. Together AI counts every token processed and bills variably. Oxlo.ai uses a request-based SLA, meaning you purchase a fixed tier (e.g., $49.90/mo for 2000 requests per day) and every request costs the same, whether it generates 100 tokens or 10,000 tokens."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it difficult to switch from Together AI?",
      answer: "No. Both platforms emulate the OpenAI SDK API structure. To migrate, you only need to change your `base_url` to `https://api.oxlo.ai/v1` and swap your API key."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Oxlo.ai have the same models as Together AI?",
      answer: "Oxlo.ai supports 40+ leading open-source models including Llama 3.3 70B, Qwen 3 32B, DeepSeek R1, Mistral, and multimodal vision and audio models. Many are the exact same weights hosted on Together AI."
